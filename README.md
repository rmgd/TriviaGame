# TriviaGame

Welcome to my basic trivia game, catagory is, Geography, with multiple choice  options.

The player will have a limited time length to finish the game. When the time runs out (regardless of whether or not they finished), the game will end and they will be shown the number of answers they got correct or incorrect.

There will be a counter counting down the remaining time.

The player should NOT be able to pick more than one answer for each question.

Enjoy :)
